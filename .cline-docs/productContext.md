# Rig Framework Analysis & Integration Strategy

## Core Components & Capabilities

1. Agent System
    - Powerful abstraction for LLM-powered applications
    - Supports multiple providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
    - Extensible with tools and dynamic context
    - Perfect for implementing trading logic and decision making
2. RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
    - Built-in vector store integrations (MongoDB, SQLite, etc.)
    - Supports embedding models for semantic search
    - Ideal for maintaining trading history and market analysis
3. Tool System
    - Flexible tool definition and implementation
    - Async support for real-time operations
    - Error handling and type safety
    - Well-suited for implementing trading operations
4. Birdeye Integration (In Progress)
    - Key features implemented:
        - Token search and analysis
        - Wallet tracking
        - Market impact calculation
        - Liquidity analysis
        - Price history tracking

## Architecture Recommendations

1. Core Agent Structure

    ```rust
    struct TradingAgent {
        llm_agent: Agent<OpenAI>,
        vector_store: MongoDBStore,
        birdeye: BirdeyeProvider,
    }
    ```

2. Vector Store Usage
    - Store historical trades
    - Market analysis data
    - Token performance metrics
    - Trading patterns
3. Tool Implementation
    - Market analysis tools
        - Trade execution tools
        - Risk management tools
        - Portfolio tracking tools
4. Integration Points
    - Birdeye for market data
    - Solana for transactions
    - Twitter for trade announcements
    - Custom models (Titans/Mamba) via Python bridge

## Implementation Strategy

1. Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
    - Complete Birdeye integration
    - Set up vector store for market data
    - Implement basic trading tools
2. Phase 2: Trading Logic
    - Implement market analysis
    - Risk management system
    - Position sizing logic
3. Phase 3: AI Integration
    - Connect custom models
    - Implement RAG for market analysis
    - Develop trading strategies
4. Phase 4: Social Integration
    - Twitter integration
    - Personality implementation
    - Trade announcement system

## Current Priorities

1. Fix Birdeye Integration
    - Debug failing tests
    - Complete API implementation
    - Add comprehensive error handling
2. Set Up Vector Store
    - Choose optimal store (MongoDB recommended for scale)
    - Design embedding schema
    - Implement data persistence
3. Core Agent Implementation
    - Define system prompts
    - Implement trading tools
    - Set up market analysis pipeline

## Technical Considerations

1. Performance
    - Use async operations for real-time trading
    - Implement efficient caching
    - Optimize vector searches
2. Reliability
    - Implement robust error handling
    - Add transaction verification
    - Include system health monitoring
3. Scalability
    - Design for multiple trading pairs
    - Plan for high-frequency updates
    - Consider distributed architecture
4. Security
    - Secure key management
    - Transaction signing safety
    - Rate limiting and quotas
