I notice from the error message that there seems to be an issue with the `cargo add` command. The error indicates that there are multiple packages in the workspace, and Cargo doesn't know which one to modify. Let me help investigate and fix this.

First, let me check the workspace structure to better understand what we're working with.

I see this is a Rust workspace with multiple crates. To fix the `cargo add` issue, you need to specify which package you want to add the dependency to using the `--package` flag. 

Let me propose the correct command:
