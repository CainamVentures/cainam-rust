## Fixing Missing Trait Error in Rust (1/21/2025, 9:35:27 AM)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
cannot find trait `Plugin` in this scope
not found in this scope
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me help fix the missing `Plugin` trait error. We need to import the `Plugin` trait, which is likely from the `rig-core` crate.

I'll add the necessary import:

---

_**Assistant**_

```
use rig_core::plugin::{Plugin, PluginRegistrar};
// ... existing code ...
```

---

_**Assistant**_



We also need to add `rig-core` as a dependency. Let me check the Cargo.toml:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



I see that `rig-core` is already a dependency. The remaining errors about `TokenSearchAction` and `WalletSearchAction` suggest these types need to be defined. However, since those are part of your plugin's implementation details and not directly related to the `Plugin` trait error, I'll let you handle those separately if needed.

The original error about the `Plugin` trait should now be resolved with the added import. Let me know if you need help with the other errors!

_**User**_

Yes I need you to define the remaining errors. We're converting from typescript to rust for our @Eliza Docs implementation

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help define the missing `TokenSearchAction` and `WalletSearchAction` types based on the Eliza documentation. We'll create these actions in a new `actions` module.

---

_**Assistant**_

```
use std::fmt;
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
use rig_core::plugin::{Plugin, PluginRegistrar};

pub mod providers;
pub mod types;
pub mod actions;

pub use types::*;
pub use actions::*;
// ... existing code ...
```

---

_**Assistant**_



Now let's create the actions module with our action types:

---

_**Assistant**_

```
use rig_core::action::Action;
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct TokenSearchAction {
    pub keyword: String,
    pub sort_by: Option<String>,
    pub sort_type: Option<String>,
    pub offset: Option<u32>,
    pub limit: Option<u32>,
}

impl Action for TokenSearchAction {
    const NAME: &'static str = "birdeye.search_tokens";
    type Output = Vec<super::TokenInfo>;
}

#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct WalletSearchAction {
    pub address: String,
}

impl Action for WalletSearchAction {
    const NAME: &'static str = "birdeye.search_wallet";
    type Output = Vec<super::TokenInfo>;
}
```

_**Assistant**_



The remaining error about `rig_core` not being found suggests we need to ensure the workspace is properly set up. Can you verify that:

1. The `rig-core` crate exists in your workspace (it should be at `../rig-core` relative to `rig-birdeye`)
2. Your workspace's Cargo.toml includes both crates in its members

Let me know if you need help with the workspace setup!

_**User**_

rig-core is in the same directory as rig-birdeye @rig-core @rig-birdeye 

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me check the Cargo.toml in rig-birdeye to ensure the dependency is properly configured:

I see another error: there's an ambiguity with the actions module - it exists in both `actions.rs` and `actions/mod.rs`. Let's fix this by removing one of them:
